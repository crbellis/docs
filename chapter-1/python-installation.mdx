# Getting started

Python comes pre-installed on some machines so before we install a version you should check to see if already have Python installed. You can open up a terminal
and run `
python --version` to see if python is installed. If you already have python installed you'll see something like this:

```bash Example output
Python 3.9.6
```

For this book we'll use `python3.9` or above. If your version is less than this, follow the directions below or refer to the official Python documentation.

<Note>
	Alternatively, you can use Python in your web browser using Google Colab.
	This is a very convenient way to get started with Python without installing
	anything on your machine. You can find more information about Google Colab
	[here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

    If you do choose to use Google Colab, you can skip to [section 1.4](/chapter-1/1.4-What-is-Python).
