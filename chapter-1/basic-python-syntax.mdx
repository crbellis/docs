## Creating a Python file

If you downloaded your own IDE, you can create a new python file by creating a new file and the file name with the extension `.py`. For example, `hello.py`.
If you're using a notebook like Google Colab, you can create a new notebook by going to `File > New Notebook`.

In your new file, you can write your Python code. For example, you can write the following code in your new file:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

## Running a Python file

To run a python file, you can either click the run button in your IDE or notebook, or you can run the file from the command line. To run a python file from the command line, you can use the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

This will run the `hello.py` file. You should see the following output:

```bash
Hello, Python!
```

## Understanding Python Syntax

Python's syntax is designed for readability and simplicity, making it an ideal language for beginners and experienced developers alike. In this section, we'll cover some fundamental aspects of Python syntax to get you started.

### 1.4.1 Variables, Data Types and Comments

In Python, you can create variables to store data. Variables don't require explicit declaration; **Python infers the data type based on the assigned value**.

```python
# Example of variable assignment
message = "Hello, Python!"
count = 42
pi_value = 3.14
```

In Python, variable names have a few rules:

1. A variable must start with a letter or underscore.
2. A variable cannot start with a number.
3. A variable can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ ).
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).

#### Comments

In the above snippet, you may recognize the `#` symbol. This symbol is used to denote a comment. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are used to annotate code. Comments are useful for explaining what a particular piece of code does. For example, you can use comments to explain the purpose of a variable or piece of code.

```python
# This is a comment in Python, this code will not be executed
```

#### Data Types

Now that we know how to name variables, we need to know what _kind_ of data these variables store. In Python, there are several data types. Here are the primitive data types:

#### Primitive Data Types

1. `int`: An integer value (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
2. `float`: A floating-point value (e.g., 1.0, 2.2, 310.83)
3. `bool`: A boolean value (e.g., True or False)
4. `str`: A string value (e.g., "Hello, Python!")

In our example above, our `message` variable is a `str`, our `count` variable is an `int`, and our `pi_value` variable is a `float`.

Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you can reassign variables to different data types. For example, you can reassign the `message` variable to an integer value:

```python
message = -12 # message is now an int
```

#### Non-Primitive Data Types

In addition to the primitive data types, Python also has non-primitive data types. These data types are more complex and can be thought of as containers for other data types. Here are some examples of non-primitive data types:

1. `list`: A list of values (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` is a list of `int`)
2. `tuple`: A tuple of values (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)` is a tuple of `int`)
3. `set`: A set of values (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}` is a set of `int`)
4. `dict`: A dictionary of key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "John", "age": 42}` is a dictionary with `str` keys and `int` values)

We'll cover these data types in more detail in the next sections.

#### A Special Type

`NoneType`: A special type representing the absence of a value (e.g., `None`)

### 1.4.2 Logging to the Console

Earlier in this section we used a special tool in Python called a function. We used the function `print` which takes in an argument and displays that argument back to the user. For example, we can use the `print` function to display the value of a variable to the user or a literal (which is a value that is not stored in a variable).

You can log variables to the console using the `print` function:

```python
print(message) # prints the variable message to the console
print("This is a string literal") # prints the string literal "This is a string literal" to the console
print(5) # prints the integer 5 to the console
print(pi_value) # prints the variable pi_value to the console
```

### 1.4.3 Basic Operations

Python supports standard arithmetic operations:

```python
# Example of basic operations
sum_result = 5 + 3
difference_result = 10 - 4
product_result = 6 * 7
quotient_result = 20 / 4
expo_result = 2 ** 3
```

We can also perform operations on variables:

```python
# Example of operations on variables
x = 5
y = 3
result = x + y
print(result) # print the sum of x + y
result = x * y # reassign result to the product of x * y
print(result)
```

There is also a shorthand notation for performing operations on variables:

```python
# Example of shorthand operations
x = 5
x += 3 # equivalent to x = x + 3
print(x)
x -= 3 # equivalent to x = x - 3
print(x)
```
